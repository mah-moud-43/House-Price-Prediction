# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing dataset. It leverages machine learning regression models to estimate property values based on key features such as location, housing age, number of rooms, population, income, and proximity to the ocean.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data preprocessing: handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Feature scaling for improved model performance.
- Training and evaluation of multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Model performance comparison using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Interactive Gradio interface for real-time, user-friendly price predictions.
